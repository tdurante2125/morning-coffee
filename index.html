        <p>Obviously the first step to having morning coffee is to get the coffee brewing. The steps are simple.

        <ol>
            <li>Add water</li>
            <li>Add coffee grain (using a filter)</li>
            <li>Press the "Brew Now" button</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations! You're coffee is brewing, now we just need to wait for it to be ready.</p>
